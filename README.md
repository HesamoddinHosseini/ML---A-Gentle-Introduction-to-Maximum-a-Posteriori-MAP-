# ML - A Gentle Introduction to Maximum a Posteriori (MAP)

 
Density estimation is the problem of estimating the probability distribution for a sample of observations from a problem domain.

Typically, estimating the entire distribution is intractable, and instead, we are happy to have the expected value of the distribution, such as the mean or mode. Maximum a Posteriori or MAP for short is a Bayesian-based approach to estimating a distribution and model parameters that best explain an observed dataset.


This flexible probabilistic framework can be used to provide a Bayesian foundation for many machine learning algorithms, including important methods such as linear regression and logistic regression for predicting numeric values and class labels respectively, and unlike maximum likelihood estimation, explicitly allows prior belief about candidate models to be incorporated systematically.
